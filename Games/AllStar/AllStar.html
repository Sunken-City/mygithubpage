                      AllStar is a multiplayer couch-competitive preparathon game where players build up spaceships to compete in a gauntlet of minigames.
                      The game was created for my <a href="Cloudy_Thesis.pdf">Master's Thesis</a>, built from the ground up using my own homemade engine, written in C++ and using OpenGL for rendering.
                    </br>
                      The game has two phases, the Assembly phase and the Challenge phase. Players start in Assembly mode, where they are dropped into an open arena.

                    <p>
                      Players are given 5 minutes to roam around the arena and collect various pickups and equipment for their ships, fight AI enemies and players, and prepare for the unknown challenges upcoming Challenge Phase.
                      Once the 5 minutes are up, players are thrown into a gauntlet of 3 random minigames, using their custom built ships to compete. Whoever wins the most points during the minigames will
                      be crowned the winner!

                              Players can teleport using the left trigger, warping forward a fixed distance in the direction of their choosing.
                              Teleporting can be used to avoid enemies and obstacles, and gives all ship builds a quick movement option.

                              This feature ended up being one of my favorite learnings about game design that I took away from working on this game.

                              I had initially created this as one of the original active pickups for the game, along side some of the other active abilities.
                              When I playtested the game with all of the new abilities, however, this ended up not only the most fun option, but it was the best-in-slot ability and blew the other abilities out of the water.
                              While I could have attempted to balance this ability with the others, I realized that I'd stumbled upon something awesome, and I decided to promote it to a native movement option for the game.

                              This was the best choice, as it not only gave every player one of the most satisfying ways to move in-game, but gave the game an incredible amount of depth. Combat was no longer just about who
                              had the better ship build, but more skill-oriented thanks to the teleport emphasising mobility, spacing, and trickery. As a limited resource, players have to think carefully about when and where
                              they use it, creating interesting choices in battle and exploration. No matter how slow of a ship you created, you always had a burst movement option to surprise opponents or get out of trouble.

                              I learned firsthand that balance problems can be solved in vastly different ways, and what might appear to be an issue at first could be a brand new avenue for adding value and depth to your game.

                              AllStar has three different weapon pickups aside from the default laser gun.
                              The Wave Gun fires three shots that all converge on a point, which encourages targeting enemies in the sweet spot for massive damage.
                              The Spread Shot shoots a multitude of close-range bullets, giving players who enjoy up-close and personal battles an advantage.
                              The Missile Launcher unloads missiles that home in on nearby enemies, which create damage-on-contact explosions in their wake.

                              During assembly mode, I wanted a series of interesting trade-offs while building your ship, giving players the opportunity to build their ships around different play styles.
                              When it came time to create weapons, I took some inspiration from one of my favorite game designers, Masahiro Sakurai. In the Super Smash Bros. series of games, there exist three characters (Marth, Roy, and Lucina)
                              who, through different iterations in the series, all had the same exact moveset. However, by changing the "sweet spot" on their swords (which part of their blade did the most damage) they all managed to derive completely
                              different playstyles from what was essentially the same character. By changing up the incentives for long-range versus short-range combat on each character, Sakurai was able to stretch his development resources and provide meaningful choices for players.
                              Considering I was facing a short timetable for the project, I focused on creating a weapon for each of those distinct playstyles, covering a large spectrum of gameplay options with only three equippable guns.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              The Spread Shot was the "Roy" gun, where I wanted to create a weapon that encouraged close-range combat. The inclusion of this gun gave more meaning to the Tank Chassis, which moved slowly but could take a lot of hits, and players could
                              combine this ability to shrug off enemy bullets while approaching with the punishing damage of a point-blank Spread Shot attack. This also empowered stealth builds which utilized the Cloak passive (granting invisibility while motionless) and
                              hiding in nebula, making sneak attacks easier to pull off on unsuspecting opponents.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              For players who wanted to focus on mobility and staying just out of reach, I added the Wave Gun, inspired by Marth's spacing-oriented gameplay. The weapon features three shots that all converge on a focal point, and
                              skilled players who are able to keep their opponents in that sweet spot can take advantage of the increased damage output. Builds with more mobility, such as those using the Speed Chassis (which improves base Top Speed and Acceleration),
                              are able to benefit from the weapon the most, avoiding enemy fire while swooping in for the quick sweetspot kill.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              Finally, for players who pine for a more generalist playstyle, I created the Missile Launcher. Because Lucina had no sweetspot on her sword in Super Smash Bros., she was able to adapt to any situation her opponents put her in, at the expense of
                              specializing in one area. The Missile Launcher provided a good option for this playstyle, and also made for an accessible choice for users newer to twin-stick shooters by lessening the need for precise aiming. This weapon also enhanced the
                              Black Hole Chassis (providing a homing boost for your bullets, at the cost of bullets homing in more easily on you), making the missiles even more deadly on the battlefield.

                              Portals can exist on any blockface, even the above and below faces of a block.
                              This allows the player to jump down a portal, adding creative ways to get around the world.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              While working on some of the portal physics, I had a bug where if there were blocks behind the portal I'd be unable to pass through, getting stuck inside of
                              the blocks inside this dimension after starting to move into them. I knew I needed to resolve this issue by giving each of my preventative raycast points a sense of what world they were in.
                              Before I start my preventative raycasts, I raycast from the player's center out to each of the 12 points on the bounding box, which gives me the world each of those endpoints is in.
                              This way, when they start the raycast to see if the player can move without hitting anything, each of them checks against the correct world's blocks, allowing players to pass through solid blocks
                              in one world into open air in another.

                              I added colored lighting to the game as well.
                              These colors mix together as they propogate throughout the world, capable of lighting blocks with any 24-bit RGB color.

                              Colored lights also propogate across portal boundaries as well!
                              Since the light propogation uses an abstracted version of the blocks to provide seamless transitions across chunk boundaries,
                              I was able to expand that to support portals. Whenever a block attempts to grab one of it's neighbors,
                              I check to see if there's a portal on the face that I'm about to cross. If so, we swap dimensions and continue propogation.
                              Because of the abstract representation of blocks I built, this was a much easier problem to solve than it would appear.

                              When looking through a portal, you can dig and place blocks through the portal into the other world.
                              If you open up a portal into a wall deep underground, you can dig a little crawl space out through the portal to pass through.

                              This is one of the most exciting ideas I had about the real-time nether portals when I began designing how they would work.
                              The idea that if I opened a portal somewhere that was buried underground, I would be able to dig a crawlspace out through the portal to enter the other world.
                              This works in game because I refactored my Amanatides-Woo Raycast function to account for portals, such that they can cross portal boundaries and begin interacting with the other world.
                              Since my block digging and placing uses this raycast, adding in support for portals allowed the raycast to begin working across boundaries immediately.
                              Although it definitely needs some polish to be a gameplay feature that users understand, the concept works just like it should and enables portals to be flexible for users without automatically destroying blocks in the other world.

                              I wrote a simple profiler during the initial development to figure out where I was spending my time each frame, which helped me root out a few problems with my chunk management.
                              This helped me to prove what parts of my code weren't performant, and helped me to prove when assumptions I was making were valid or invalid, helping me to better understand my codebase.

                              The 2nd from the left is my portal depth buffer, a second color target that I have attached to the first pass of the shader, where it writes out the depth of any portal values, and writes
                              the max depth for any geometry that isn't a portal. This target is used in the second pass of the shader, and is how I determine what can be drawn in the portal area. Only things behind
                              this portal are able to be drawn, and since everything else that's not a portal is at max depth, nothing can be drawn behind it, making this color target function like a combination of stencil and depth buffer.
