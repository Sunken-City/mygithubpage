                      Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game where players can build, explore, craft, and battle to their heart's content.
                      I joined the team in 2017 as part of the Graphics Team, working on the Super Duper graphics pack.
                      When the team eventually put the project on hold, I transferred over to the Vanilla Gameplay team to collaborate with
                      designers and focus on creating great gameplay experiences.

                    <p>
                      I've been working on gameplay for multiple major updates,
                      including "Update Aquatic" and "Village & Pillage", challenging myself with as many different parts of the codebase as
                      I can. So far I've been able to add new world generation techniques, mobs, biomes, blocks, structures and more. I've also
                      added data driven components and behaviors for mobs with 3rd party content creators in mind, helping us to iterate quicker
                      and build faster while simultaneously enabling our community to do even more with our game!

                              Prior to "Update Aquatic", any blocks placed underwater would have a pocket of air surrounding them.
                              I worked on adding support for two blocks co-existing in the same place so that we could put water inside of other blocks, which resulted in a lot of fun gameplay opportunities!
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              This is one of the features I'm the most proud of working on. Minecraft was built around an assumption of one block per coordinate in a chunk,
                              and the addition of water inside of other blocks would not only create a large amount of code churn, but would involve a rework of the legacy water code.
                              When I started the work, I was informed that a majority of our update depended on this feature being delivered on time and of high quality, or else we might miss the milestone.
                              Despite being the newest member of the Gameplay Team, I was able to rapidly ramp up in the space, gain the support and knowledge I needed from others, and implement this major refactor.
                              We ultimately solved the problem by creating an "extra block" layer for chunks that could hold extra blocks, along with helper functions to make finding and accessing the block
                              you were looking for easy. By swapping over many of the checks for water blocks in spaces to a new "find water at this position" call, I was able to maintain the functionality
                              of the previous code without sacrificing readability, which expedited the refactor of this hard-coded assumption.

                              For the "Village & Pillage" update, we reworked how villages are generated to create more complex and believeable villages.
                              I worked on modifying the world's terrain so that once the game eventually placed the houses, they'd all have natural-looking foundations.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              The "Beards and Shavers" system is a terrain generation sub-step that I added to world generation to ensure that houses and structures would be placed in believable locations.
                              If we knew that a particular chunk would hold part of a village, or be close enough to be influenced by it, we would trigger this system to modify the terrain.
                              After generating a first pass of heightmaps for the terrain, we would determine the location we wanted to put the village structure. We then use a kernel to
                              manipulate nearby heights and generate a new, flatter area to place the structure on (a "beard"). If the structure would spawn intersecting a cliff or mountain,
                              this kernel would also pull down heightmap values and carve out space for the structure (a "shaver"). This would all happen before the terrain was decorated,
                              and after many other world generation passes, the structure would find an oddly convenient spot to be placed. It was a lot of fun tuning this system to find a
                              balance between being functional and looking convincing in the landscape.

                              Pandas in Minecraft have a unique genetics system that determines which of the 7 types of panda their offspring will become.
                              I created a genetics component that can be added on any in-game mob, solving the above design goals while being generalized enough to
                              be used on other mobs, allowing our marketplace partners to build even more cool things!
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              This was one of my favorite things to program, because I not only got to create a neat genetics system to integrate with our breeding mechanics,
                              but I was able to successfully advocate for generalizing this component to enable content creators to make more complex breeding add-ons for the marketplace.
                              Although the original design asked for a "main" and "hidden" allele system slightly different from the way regular genetics works,
                              I added support for dominant and recessive genes so that content creators who use the component can use either minecraft-style or realistic genetics.
                              The debug information displayed over the animal's head shows the main and hidden allele for that animal. When breeding between the two animals occurs,
                              each parent contributes one of their alleles for each of their genes, with a small chance of mutation to introduce new variety into the gene pool.
                              Once the offspring's genes have been determined, the genetics component looks at the JSON-defined genetic events, and proceeds to add and remove
                              different component groups on the mob to modify it's appearance, behavior, or anything a content creator can think of!

                              As part of their debut in "Update Aquatic", dolphins can be bribed with a fresh fish to lead you towards treasure!
                              I programmed this behavior so dolphins can help you find shipwrecks or sunken ruins that you might have easily missed while swimming on the surface.

                              When a dolphin is bribed and the behavior trigers, I do a quick search to find the nearest available underwater treasure, as predetermined by
                              world generation. Thanks to our use of perlin noise for structure generation, I was able to use this "mathematical predestination" to find where we
                              planned to put one of those features, even if it didn't exist yet. Once I had the coordinates of the location, I'd get a direct vector to the structure
                              and check to see if it was close enough to pathfind to. If it wasn't, I'd have the dolphin path as far as it could in the correct direction, then give up
                              after it realized a single fish wasn't worth the journey. Perhaps another might persuade it to give you a little more guidance?

                              As part of the "Cats & Pandas" update, I added the Bamboo Jungle to world generation as a new rare variant of a jungle biome.
                              Bamboo Jungles are home to a plentiful amount of bamboo, and players are more likely to find pandas within the biome.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              In order to add the Bamboo Jungle biome while disturbing as little of the rest of biome generation as possible, they're created
                              by converting a small portion of a larger Jungle biome during generation. We generate biomes with something similar to a diamond-square algorithm,
                              where we take some high-level biomes and slowly zoom in over multiple iterations, adding and modifying with each pass. By adding them once we
                              know where Jungle is going to exist, we can avoid shifting the overarching biome map for existing worlds, while giving new worlds a natural
                              progression into the biome. The biome is compositionally similar to the Jungle, but uses a series of new decorators to give it a unique feel.
                              I added a special bamboo feature for the Bamboo Jungles that has a small chance of turning a radius of grass underneath it into podzol, to give the
                              terrain a little variety. Trees are slightly more sparse, and I added higher probability for gaps in the trees and bamboo to give the pandas more
                              room to spawn in and walk around.

                              Pillager Outposts are menacing structures filled with Pillagers that spawn in the overworld as part of the "Village & Pillage" update.
                              Players can raid the structure to take out the Pillager Captain at the top, earning them the "Bad Omen" mob effect used to trigger a raid.

                              As part of our co-development with the Java Minecraft team, this feature involved a lot of reinterpretation and negotiation as I brought it
                              to life in the Bedrock codebase. At the time, the "Beards and Shavers" system wasn't implemented in Bedrock, nor was it scheduled for a few
                              months, and I had to figure out how to resolve placement issues in the world without being able to modify terrain before placement. Unlike
                              previous structures that would just build a supporting foundation of cobblestone, I opted to "pull-down" certain blocks to help compensate
                              for uneven terrain. This way, the tower's wooden support pillars would always line up with the ground, creating a more believable structure.
                              Due to differences in monster spawning in Java and Bedrock, I programmed for a set number of Pillagers to spawn at
                              designer-specified locations. This ensured that the first encounter with each outpost would be consistent, while still
                              allowing for enemies to respawn if players were itching for more fighting.
