                    King Pufferfish is an endless, top-down defense shooter where the player battles waves of invading sea creatures.
                    Players shoot spines from their pufferfish avatar and then scrub away the vision-impairing ink left by fleeing enemies.
                    The game focuses on periods of precision shooting, avoiding mines and clearing ink, contrasted with high-intensity moments, shooting flurries of spines to dispatch hordes of enemies.

                    I was the project lead for King Pufferfish, as well as one of the two programmers on the team. The project gave me a great opportunity to practice and hone my
                    leadership skills, and I was able to keep the project on track and well-scoped for the majority of the project. The game was a lot of fun to make, and I learned
                    the value of creating the game around a central mechanic and building up from that core.

                              Whenever a player defeats an enemy, the enemy leaves behind a cloud of ink and retreats.
                              If the player starts swiping the ink on the screen, the player will start scrubbing the ink off, restoring visibility.

                              Implementing this feature was easy, but perfecting it was the hard part. When I initially programmed this feature, I made it so that
                              pressing on an ink blob would start the scrubbing sequence until you let up. However, this ended up being confusing and frustrating to playtesters
                              and I had to come up with a new solution for the problem. After a lot of iteration, I ended up with a system that registered taps and presses less than half
                              a second long as shots, and I made it so that if the change in position of the player's finger crossed a certain threshold, they would start scrubbing
                              until they let go of their finger, returning to default. This feature helped me to realize the value of playtesting, as all of the systems that I thought would
                              be clear enough turned out to be lacking when applied to the target audience. I learned to cater my design decisions towards their actual needs, instead
                              of what I thought would satisfy their needs, and I learned that I can only find out what those needs are through the process of playtesting.

                              When a player taps on the screen, they shoot out one of King Pufferfish's spines. This is how players combat the invading squids and octopi, and advance through the level.

                              Because shooting was half of our core loop, and one of the two actions the player did most, I made sure to ensure that shooting was not only easy, but felt good as well.
                              I calculated the direction of any shot by taking the player's finger tap in the game world, converted it from screen to world space, and then orienting the spine in a
                              direction based on the difference in position between King Pufferfish and the tap. With this, aiming felt natural, as the players would send spines to exactly
                              where they wanted on the map. Because of our team's focus on getting the core mechanics in and down as soon as possible, this functionality was in the game first,
                              making our development an iterative process in polish as opposed to a race to implement everything.

                              In order for our designers to be able to quickly iterate on the game's wave structure, I created a set of design tools that helped to make wave design easy.
                              Designers are able to order and list all of the enemies in a wave easily, modify spawn positions, orientation, and other important pieces needed to create and iterate rapidly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-align">
                              Although at the outset, the designers were fine with the idea of just placing the enemies in the level, I was adamant about spending the development time in order to make the wave system.
                              As the project lead, I recognized that investing in a system would pay dividends later on in development and would save time overall. I drew on my experiences from designing tools while at
                              Fractal Fox and created scripts that made waves as physical Unity asset files. With each of the waves as a file, we were able to version the waves in source control, allowing us
                              to roll back changes if things went wrong. The system included a custom Unity editor that allowed the designers to modify waves while in-engine, and the Game Controller allowed for
                              the use of debugging waves, so that the designers could quickly test out a particluar wave before adding it to the big queue of waves. I really enjoyed making a tool that helped my
                              teammates work quicker and demonstrate more of their full potential.

                              The Game Controller is responsible for all of the game's flow, and contains an array of all of the game's waves designed by the designers.
                              The script plays through the waves one by one, keeping track of all of the state and dropping down the wave sign in between waves. The Game Controller
                              also plays the music and sound effects, and keeps track of the player's health and any other state transitions needed. After the player runs out of waves
                              that the designers made for the game, it discards the first three tutorial waves and shuffles all of the other remaining waves, allowing players to continue on forever.

                              Every 4th wave in the game is a "Rage Wave", where the enemies come at the player in a horde instead of a la carte.
                              However, with the onslaught of the enemies, the players are able to swipe the screen to rapid fire shots and eliminate the wave.

                            <p class="left-align">
                              Implementing these waves wasn't a difficult task, nor was the rapid fire any trouble, but the conveyance of the change in game pace was the real challenge.
                              Because scrubbing the screen was extremely similar to the "hold and aim" mechanic needed to efficiently use the machine gun, it was hard to get players to
                              use the rapid-fire, as most just kept trying to tap until they got overwhelmed. As a team, we took the playtesting feedback and worked towards a system that
                              would inform the players of how to handle the new segment, which ended up forming our tutorial system. Without this difficult design challenge, we were on
                              the path towards ignoring a tutorial, favoring minimalism. However, because of our playtest feedback telling us that we weren't succeeding in telling the players
                              how to play the game, we were able to accept the bad news, do something about it, and make a better game as a result.

                              The enemies in King Pufferfish include the Squids, who swim straight down, the Octopi, who zig-zag about while approaching and have more health,
                              the mines, which explode and damage everything on screen (including you!), and the Jellyfish, who tank hits and split into smaller jellyfish when destroyed.

                              I created the base script for the enemies in the game, which defined the common components all enemies have. This class heirarchy made it easy to design
                              the wave tool, as designers were able to drag and drop any of the enemy prefabs that they wanted and have them behave in a similar manner, and made it easy
                              to distinguish when something was hitting the wall that should do damage. I also programmed the zig-zag pattern of the octopi using sinusoidal motion, and
                              added the hearts as a subclass so that they would spawn in a similar manner during waves.
